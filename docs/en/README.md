## Overview

This is the unofficial PowerShell SDK. The intention and purpose behind my design of this SDK is to simplify everyone's access to the OpenAI service, and to seamlessly integrate it with their daily work. At first, it was intended to meet my own needs, and then gradually expanded and formed a relatively complete and comprehensive version. Currently, it supports not only the invocation of the OpenAI service, but also the Azure OpenAI service, and even recently started to support local model support. In addition, it is not a simple API encapsulation in the strict sense, but an SDK closer to the PowerShell usage scenario, such as supporting pipeline operations, custom output formats, file input and output, etc., which will greatly improve the efficiency of users.
