## Overview

This is an unofficial PowerShell SDK. The original intention and purpose of designing this SDK is to simplify everyone's access to the OpenAI service, and to seamlessly combine it with their daily work. Initially, it was to meet my own needs, then it gradually expanded, and formed a more complete and perfected version, which currently supports not only OpenAI service calls, but also Azure OpenAI service calls, and even recently supported local model support. Besides, it's not a simple API encapsulation, but an SDK that's more closely aligned with the PowerShell usage scenarios, such as supporting pipeline operations, supporting custom output formats, and supporting file input and output. This will greatly improve user efficiency.
