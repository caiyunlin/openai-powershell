This is an unofficial PowerShell SDK. My intention and purpose for designing this SDK are to simplify everyone's access to the OpenAI service, and integrate it seamlessly into their daily work. Initially, it was actually to solve my own needs, then gradually expanded and formed a relatively complete and comprehensive version. Currently, it supports not only the OpenAI service calls, but also Azure OpenAI service calls, and even lately it has added support for local models. Furthermore, it's not just a simple API wrapper, but a more fitting PowerShell usage scenario SDK, such as supporting pipeline operations, supporting custom output formats, supporting file input and output, etc. This will greatly improve user efficiency.
