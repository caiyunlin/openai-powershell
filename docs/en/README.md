description: This is an unofficial PowerShell SDK that I designed with the intention and purpose of simplifying everyone's access to OpenAI services, and seamlessly integrating it with their daily work. Initially, it was to meet my own needs, then gradually expanded, and has become a relatively complete and refined version, which currently supports not only OpenAI service calls, but also Azure OpenAI service calls, and even recently added support for local models. Moreover, it is not a simple API package, but a SDK that is more closely aligned with the PowerShell usage scenario, such as supporting pipeline operations, customizing output formats, and file input and output, which will greatly improve the user's efficiency.
