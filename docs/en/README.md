## Overview

This is an unofficial PowerShell SDK. The initial intention and purpose of designing this SDK is to simplify everyone's access to OpenAI services and seamlessly integrate it with their daily work. Initially, it was to solve my own needs, then gradually expanded, and formed a relatively complete and improved version. Currently, it supports both OpenAI service calls and Azure OpenAI service calls, and even recently supports local model support. Furthermore, it is not a simple API encapsulation, but an SDK that is closer to the PowerShell usage scenario, such as supporting pipeline operations, supporting customized output format, supporting file input and output, etc. This will greatly improve user efficiency.
