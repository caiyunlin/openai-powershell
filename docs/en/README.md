## Overview

This is an unofficial PowerShell SDK. My initial intent and purpose of designing this SDK is to simplify the difficulty of accessing OpenAI services and seamlessly integrate them into your daily work. At first, it was actually to meet my own needs. Then it gradually expanded and formed a relatively complete and refined version. Currently, it not only supports OpenAI service calls, but also supports Azure OpenAI service calls, and even recently supports local model support. In addition, it is not a simple API wrapper, but a SDK closer to the PowerShell usage scenario, such as supporting pipeline operations, supporting custom output formats, supporting file input and output, etc., which will greatly improve user efficiency.
