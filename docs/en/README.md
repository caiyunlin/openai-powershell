description: This is an unofficial PowerShell SDK, designed with the intent and purpose of simplifying the difficulty of accessing OpenAI services for everyone, and seamlessly integrating it with their daily work. Initially, it was designed to solve my own needs, then gradually expanded, forming a relatively complete and integrated version. Currently, it supports both OpenAI services and Azure OpenAI services, and even recently supports local model services. Furthermore, it is not just a simple API wrapper but an SDK closer to PowerShell usage scenarios, supporting pipeline operations, customizable output formats, file input, and output, etc. Thus, significantly improving user efficiency.

## Discussing about the current AI development 

Did you hear about the snow in 2022 that came late compared to previous years? And the spring breeze of 2023 was indeed accompanied with the emergence and spread of ChatGPT in the world. In China, happiness and prosperity are abundant. It is a golden era for everyone and the grand event of Artificial Intelligence. In this era, Artificial Intelligence is no longer a strange term, but has deeply penetrated into our lives and become a part of our lives. As a pioneer of Artificial Intelligence, OpenAI is playing a vital role in this era.

With the constant innovation of Large Language Models (LLM), various application scenarios based on this new generation of artificial intelligence technology are also emerging. Amidst rapid development, we certainly see some problems, but what contrasts with the less optimistic global environment is that national politicians, technology elites, corporate giants, and even the public maintain an optimistic attitude towards this AI era. Artificial Intelligence may indeed replace many people's jobs in a few years, but for now, it seems to have created many jobs instead.

Suddenly, we have gained superpowers (yes, unless you are lying, don't you feel that GPT technology is like magic?). But it also brings a bother, that is how to really master this power and use it to improve our work or life, or create what you want. At present, this superpower is not free, and is even expensive in some cases. However, this is a problem that can be solved over time. 

What will the future bring? Will humans be smarter or more foolish? Sociologists might tell you the answer - even without the wave of AI, human wisdom and stupidity will be a constantly changing process. However, the GPT-represented AI technology may become an X-factor, making wise people wiser, or more foolish people more foolish. In short, it is likely to break this equilibrium – and it won't care.

## We need to use AI correctly

The tools we possess are becoming unprecedentedly rich. Text directly becomes a programming language. People expressing themselves in their native languages can accomplish some unprecedented, amazing tasks. It is undoubtedly a contribution to human civilization, making people truly be themselves.

Assume the day comes when these technologies become more widespread and safe, and more cost-effective — they will become a basic skill for humans, just like many people are born to use mobile phones now. Our descendants will most likely take these for granted. Although it is not the case.
