## Overview

This is the unofficial PowerShell SDK. The initial purpose and aim to design this SDK is to alleviate the access difficulties for the OpenAI service, and integrate it seamlessly with daily work. Initially, it was to fulfill my personal needs, then gradually expanded, forming a relatively complete and well-rounded version. Currently, it not only supports OpenAI service calls, but also Azure OpenAI service calls, and even recently offered support for local models. Moreover, it isn't just an API wrapper in a simple sense, but a more PowerShell-friendly SDK, such as supporting pipeline operations, custom output formats, and file input and output, which greatly improves user efficiency.
