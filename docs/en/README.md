description: This is an unofficial PowerShell SDK. The initial purpose and intention for designing this SDK was to simplify everyone's access to OpenAI services and to seamlessly integrate it into their daily work. Initially, it was about meeting my own needs, but then it gradually expanded and formed a relatively complete and perfected version. Currently, it supports not only OpenAI service calls, but also Azure OpenAI service calls, even local model support recently. Furthermore, it is not merely a simple API wrapper, but an SDK that more closely fits PowerShell's use scenarios, such as support for pipeline operations, customizing output formats, file input and output, etc. which greatly improves the efficiency of users.

## Talking about the Current Round of AI and its Development

Did you hear about it? The snowfall in 2022 arrived later than usual. And the spring breeze in 2023 certainly swept throughout the universe with the advent of ChatGPT. Across China, from the north to the south, there is a festive, thriving atmosphere. This is a golden age for everyone, and for artificial intelligence. In this era, artificial intelligence is no longer a strange term, but rather has permeated our daily lives and become a part of them. As a pioneer of artificial intelligence, OpenAI is playing a crucial role in this era. 

With the continuous innovation of the large language model (LLM), various application scenarios based on this new generation of artificial intelligence technology are emerging constantly. As they rapidly develop, we naturally notice some issues. Yet, contrasted against a less-than-optimistic global situation, all from national dignitaries, technology experts, corporate giants, to ordinary people, are maintaining an optimistic attitude about this round of artificial intelligence. While artificial intelligence might replace many jobs in a few years, at present, it seems to have spurred a lot of employment instead.

We suddenly have superpowers (yes, unless you are lying, don't you think GPT technology is like magic?) but have also gained a concern. That is how to truly master this ability, take advantage of it to improve our work and life, or create what you want. At present, such superpower is not free, and it can even be expensive in certain circumstances, but it may just be a problem that can be solved with time.
