## Overview

This is an unofficial PowerShell SDK. My initial purpose and goal in creating this SDK was to simplify everyone's access to the OpenAI service and seamlessly integrate it with their daily work. Initially, it was just to meet my own needs, and then it gradually expanded and developed into a relatively complete and perfect version. Currently, it supports calls to both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI services, and has even recently added support for local models. In addition, it is not a simple API wrapper but an SDK more suitable for PowerShell's usage scenarios, such as supporting pipeline operations, custom output formats, file input and output, etc. This will greatly enhance user efficiency.
