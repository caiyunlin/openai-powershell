## Overview

This is an unofficial PowerShell SDK. The original intention and purpose of designing this SDK is to simplify everyone's access to the OpenAI service and seamlessly integrate it with their daily work. At first, it was actually to solve my own needs, and then gradually expanded, and formed a relatively complete and perfect version, which currently supports both OpenAI service calls and Azure OpenAI service calls, and even recently supported local model support. In addition, it is not a simple API encapsulation in the usual sense, but an SDK that is more close to the PowerShell usage scenario, such as supporting pipeline operations, supporting custom output formats, supporting file input and output, etc., which will greatly improve user efficiency.
